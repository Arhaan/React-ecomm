# React-ecomm
An ecommerce site built with reactjs and django
This is my submission for the Jetbrains Pycharm hackathon.

To setup the project first make a .env file in `ecomm-frontend` directory. The file should contain :
```
REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:8000"
```
Then run `npm install` in this directory and then `npm start`.

For the backend go to the main directory. Run `pipenv install` and `python manage.py runserver`
